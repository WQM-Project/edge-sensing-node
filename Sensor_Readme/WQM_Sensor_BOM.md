## 3. 3D-Printed Parts & Filament

| # | Qty | Part | Material | Est. Print Weight (g) | Notes |
| --- | ----- | ------ | ---------- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| P1 | 1 | Probe mast body (sensor rack, ~30 cm) | PETG | 80–120 | Rigid, UV-resistant, waterproof. Carries all submerged sensors in fixed positions. |
| P2 | 1 | Turbidity sensor shroud/baffle | PETG | 15–25 | Side-slotted cover over SEN0189 optical window. Blocks bubble ingress. |
| P3 | 1 | DO membrane guard cage | PETG | 10–15 | Wire-mesh style cage around galvanic membrane tip. Non-negotiable protection. |
| P4 | 1 | pH bulb guard tube | PETG / PVC | 10–15 | Perforated tube recessing the glass bulb from lateral impact. |
| P5 | 1 | Cable gland mounting plate | PETG | 15–25 | Sealed hull-entry plate with holes for 6–8 cable glands. |
| P6 | 1 | BME280 + electronics mounting bracket | PLA | 5–10 | Internal hull bracket. No water contact — PLA acceptable. |
| P7 | 1 | IP68 ultrasonic hull-bottom mount | PETG | 10–15 | Angled bracket, faces sensor downward, clear of prop wash. |

| | | | **Est. Total Print Weight** | **145–225 g** | |

**Filament Required:**

| # | Qty | Description | Est. Price (₹) | Notes |
| --- | ----- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| F1 | 1 | PETG filament — 1 kg spool (white or black) | 800–1,200 | UV-resistant, waterproof, suitable for all submerged parts. ~145–225 g used; rest is spare. |
| F2 | 1 | PLA filament — 250 g or share from existing spool | 0–300 | Only for internal bracket (P6). Skip if PETG is used for everything. |

| | | | **Filament Total** | **₹800–1,500** |

> [!TIP]
> **Why PETG over PLA for submerged parts:** PLA absorbs water over days/weeks and becomes brittle. PETG is hydrophobic, UV-stable, and maintains structural integrity indefinitely underwater. All parts touching water **must** be PETG (or ASA/ABS if available).

## 5. Power Budget (Sensor Subsystem Only)

| Sensor | Active Current | Duty Cycle (Stop-and-Sample) | Avg. Current |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| pH signal board | ~5 mA | 100% (always on during mission) | 5 mA |
| Turbidity (IR LED) | ~30 mA | ~5% (reading only) | 1.5 mA |
| TDS signal board | ~5 mA | 100% | 5 mA |
| DS18B20 × 2 | ~1.5 mA each | ~5% | 0.15 mA |
| DO signal board | ~6 mA | 100% | 6 mA |
| Conductivity board | ~5 mA | 100% | 5 mA |
| ORP signal board | ~5 mA | 100% | 5 mA |
| IP68 ultrasonic (UART) | ~30 mA | ~2% | 0.6 mA |
| BME280 | ~0.3 mA | ~1% | ~0 mA |
| **Total sensor draw** | | | **~28.25 mA** |

> [!TIP]
> Sensor subsystem draws negligible current compared to propulsion motors (10–30 A). No special power management needed for sensors — they can remain powered throughout a mission without impacting battery life.

## 6. Mechanical Mounting Summary

```
HULL (top)
├── BME280 ..................... internal, away from motor heat
├── IP68 ultrasonic ........... hull bottom, facing down
│
PROBE MAST (submerged, rigid PVC/3D-printed)
├── Conductivity (K=1) ........ upper mast (fast, least sensitive)
├── TDS ....................... upper mast, few cm from conductivity
├── DS18B20 × 2 .............. mid mast (zip-tied / bracket)
├── Turbidity (SEN0189) ....... mid mast, shroud w/ side slots
├── ORP (SEN0165) ............. mid mast, BNC cable gland
├── pH (SEN0161) .............. lower mast, PVC guard tube
└── DO (SEN0237-A) ............ deepest, wire cage over membrane
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All analog sensor signal boards must share a **separate regulated power rail** from ESC/drive motors with a **star-ground topology**. This is a design decision to make before the hull is sealed — analog sensors will pick up ESC switching noise if grounding is daisy-chained.
